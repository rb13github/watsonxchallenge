# Overview
IBMÂ® Rapid Network Automation is an API-driven tool that automates, integrates and connects across the network and business. It facilitates, integrates and secures communication between platforms, services and applications.

In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, businesses face the daunting challenge of managing complex networks comprised of devices from a multitude of vendors. As networks and infrastructure grow increasingly complex, traditional approaches to automation fall short, leading to inefficiencies, siloed operations and heightened risks.


Recognizing these challenges, businesses are turning to advanced solutions like IBM Rapid Network Automation to help achieve centralized, secure and scalable automation
management. Using a low-code approach and transforming API code into deployment-ready action blocks, organizations can rapidly develop or leverage existing automation scripts, amplify their capabilities and apply robust governance measures. 


IBM Rapid Network Automation is designed to:

Accelerate mean time to resolution
Reduce time to market for new services
Increase scope to cross-stack automation
Increase automation security and compliance with centralized security and policy control

# Benefits
